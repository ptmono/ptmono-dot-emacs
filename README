directories
-----------

 - config : It contains configuration and modification of emacs packages
   such as muse, emacs-w3m, erc.
 - myel : It contains convenient tools written by me.
 - cvs	: It contains emacs packages downloaded by the version control systems.
 - etc	: It contains emacs packages downloaded by files.
 - info	: texinfo documents


Using
-----

cvs, etc, info contains many files which is not modified by me. So I
archived each directory. Each directory contains 'packages.tar.gz' file.
Just extract the file.

$ git clone https://ptmono@code.google.com/p/ptmono-dot-emacs/ .emacs.d
$ python init.py
